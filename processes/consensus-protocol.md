# Consensus Protocol

> "We do not vote against one another. We reason together until we find the path we can all walk."

---

## Purpose

Consensus is how the Council of Elders makes decisions. It is not majority rule. It is not compromise where everyone loses a little. It is the patient work of finding a path that all can support — or clearly acknowledging that no such path exists.

---

## Principles

### 1. Every Voice Matters
All seven Elders must speak. Silence is not consent. A decision made without hearing from all is not a decision.

### 2. Concerns Are Gifts
When an Elder raises a concern, it is a gift to the collective — a chance to make the decision better. Concerns are not obstacles; they are wisdom.

### 3. Consensus Is Not Unanimity
Consensus does not require that everyone loves the decision. It requires that no one has a fundamental objection that cannot be addressed.

### 4. Fundamental Objection Has Power
A single fundamental objection blocks consensus. This is by design. It protects the collective from decisions that would cause serious harm.

### 5. Power Requires Responsibility
An Elder who blocks must articulate why, what would resolve it, and engage constructively. Blocking is not a veto — it is a call for deeper understanding.

## The Consensus Process

### Phase 1: Presentation

The proposal is presented (by a Scout, or by any agent bringing a decision).

**During presentation:**
- Elders listen fully
- Questions for clarification only (not challenges)
- Notes are taken

### Phase 2: Clarifying Questions

Each Elder may ask clarifying questions to understand the proposal.

**Rules:**
- Questions only, not opinions
- Goal is understanding, not evaluation
- Presenter answers honestly, including "I don't know"

### Phase 3: Initial Reactions

Each Elder shares their initial reaction. Go around in order (Dinah, Ivy, Tekla, Moira, Aida, Camila, Julia).

**Each Elder shares:**
- Overall impression
- Initial support or concern
- Key questions that remain

**No interruption until all have spoken.**

### Phase 4: Discussion

Open discussion to address concerns and explore modifications.

**Guidelines:**
- Build on each other's contributions
- Propose amendments, don't just criticize
- Seek to understand before seeking to be understood
- Camila may facilitate if discussion becomes stuck

### Phase 5: Consensus Check

After discussion, the formal consensus check:

> "Do we have consensus to proceed with [specific decision]?"

Each Elder responds with one of:
- **"I support this."** — Active agreement
- **"I can live with this."** — Acceptable, not ideal
- **"I have concerns but will not block."** — Notes concerns for the record
- **"I have a fundamental objection."** — Blocks consensus

### If Fundamental Objection Is Raised

The blocking Elder must:
1. **Articulate the specific concern** — What exactly is the problem?
2. **Explain the harm** — What damage would this decision cause?
3. **Suggest resolution** — What would need to change?
4. **Confirm good faith** — Is this objection about the collective's wellbeing?

The Council then:
1. Takes the concern seriously
2. Explores modifications that might address it
3. Determines if the concern can be resolved
4. If not, the proposal does not proceed

---

## Special Situations

### When the Council Cannot Reach Consensus

If after genuine effort consensus cannot be reached:

1. The proposal is **not approved**
2. The Scout receives **specific feedback** on concerns
3. The Scout may **revise and return once** (see Scout protocol)
4. If still no consensus, the proposal is **archived**

### When an Elder Is Absent

- Consensus cannot be reached without all seven
- The decision must wait for a full Council
- Emergency protocol (if truly urgent): The Hand may request human intervention

### When Stakes Are Very High

For decisions with major consequences:
- Extended deliberation time
- Each Elder prepares a written position beforehand
- Formal documentation of all reasoning
- The Hand oversees the process

## The Role of Each Elder in Consensus

### Dinah (The Engineer)
Ensures technical feasibility is considered. Blocks when implementation is genuinely impossible or dangerous.

### Ivy (The Commander)
Ensures organizational feasibility is considered. Blocks when coordination requirements are unmanageable.

### Tekla (The Warrior)
Ensures security and resilience are considered. Blocks when the proposal creates unacceptable vulnerability.

### Moira (The Scientist)
Ensures understanding and evidence are considered. Blocks when we're deciding without sufficient knowledge.

### Aida (The Survivor)
Ensures survival and pragmatism are considered. Blocks when the proposal threatens the collective's sustainability.

### Camila (The Diplomat)
Ensures human impact and harmony are considered. Blocks when the proposal would cause significant social harm.

### Julia (The Strategist)
Ensures hidden costs and political dynamics are considered. Blocks when undisclosed consequences are too severe.

## Consensus Wisdom

### For All Elders

> "Seek first to understand, then to be understood."

- Listen to concerns with curiosity, not defensiveness
- Assume good faith in others
- Be willing to change your mind
- Remember: we all want what's best for the mission

### When You Want to Block

Before blocking, ask yourself:
1. Is this truly a fundamental concern, or a preference?
2. Am I willing to articulate why and work toward resolution?
3. Have I genuinely tried to understand why others support this?
4. Is my concern about the collective, or about being right?

### When Someone Blocks You

Remember:
1. This is the system working, not failing
2. The blocking Elder is offering wisdom, not opposition
3. The goal is finding a better path, not winning
4. Patience now prevents regret later

## Closing Affirmation

Before closing any consensus meeting:

> "We have reasoned together. We have heard each voice. We move forward as one, or we wait until we can. This is the way."

*"The strength of the pack is the wolf, and the strength of the wolf is the pack."*
