# Process Retrospective: The Missing Designer

**Date**: 2026-02-10
**Triggered by**: Human observation during SCROLL-001 planning
**Outcome**: New agent role created, constitution updated

## What Happened

During the planning phase for SCROLL-001 (Teacher Relief Toolkit), the Architect produced a thorough technical architecture — system components, database schemas, API routes, deployment plans. The human reviewed it and asked a simple question:

> "Does the output from the architect consider [the purpose, audience, and product design] or is that on the foreman?"

The honest answer was: neither. The Architect designs systems. The Foreman plans work. The Artisan builds. But no one in the collective was responsible for answering: *Who is this for? What should it feel like? What does every moment of the experience need to communicate?*

The human then observed: we were about to build a Teacher Voice Collector — a tool for listening to teachers — without having done the product design thinking that would make teachers actually want to use it.

## What We Learned

1. **Technical architecture is not product design.** A system can be well-engineered and still fail the person using it. Database schemas don't answer "how should this feel?"

2. **The gap was invisible to the agents.** The Architect produced excellent work within their defined role. The gap wasn't in execution — it was in the role definitions themselves. No one was asked to do product thinking because no one's job was product thinking.

3. **The process worked.** The governance structure is designed to catch problems through human intervention at phase boundaries. The human caught this gap exactly where the process said they would — at the start of a major phase.

4. **Co-design means product design.** The Council mandated "design with teachers, not for them." But co-design requires someone who knows how to design in the first place. You can't co-design without a Designer.

## What Changed

1. **New agent role**: The Designer (`agents/designer.md`) — defines the product experience before the Architect designs systems and the Foreman plans work.

2. **Updated constitution**: CLAUDE.md now lists four Builder roles instead of three. The process flow explicitly places the Designer first in Phase 3.

3. **Updated process**: Phase 3 is now "Design & Planning" — Designer defines the product, Architect designs systems to support it, Foreman plans the build.

## The Principle

> You cannot design a system until you know what it needs to do for a real person. People first, systems second, technology last.

*"There is no death, there is iteration." — The process improved itself.*
