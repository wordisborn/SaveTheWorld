## Elder Positions

| Elder | Position | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Dinah | Support | Phased approach is buildable. Admin reducer has clear technical patterns. Proof of concept first. |
| Ivy | Support | Clear phases, clear gates, clear ownership. The Foreman can plan this. |
| Tekla | Can live with this | Privacy framework gate on Phase 3 addresses core concern. Will review personally. |
| Moira | Support | Pilot-first with metrics is the right approach. Will validate theory of change. |
| Aida | Can live with this | Starting small limits exposure. Adoption risk remains but pilot approach is prudent. |
| Camila | Support | Co-design with teachers centers the humans. Warmly supports. |
| Julia | Concerns, will not block | Appropriation risk remains — districts may use the tool as political cover. Guardrails help but cannot fully prevent. Noted for retrospective. |

## Key Discussion Points

1. **Three components is three products** — Council unanimously agreed to phase delivery rather than build all at once
2. **Teacher data is sensitive** — Early warning dashboard carries surveillance risk; must not be weaponized against teachers
3. **Co-design is not optional** — Building for teachers without teacher voices would repeat the pattern of top-down solutions
4. **Theory of change needs validation** — Reducing admin burden should reduce burnout, but this must be measured, not assumed
5. **Appropriation risk is real** — Free toolkit could provide political cover for districts to avoid systemic investment
6. **School adoption is uncertain** — Open source does not mean schools will use it; pilot approach limits risk

## Modifications Made During Discussion

1. **Phased delivery**: Phase 1 (admin burden reducer) → Phase 2 (peer support network) → Phase 3 (early warning dashboard). Each phase gated on demonstrated value from prior phase.
2. **Co-design requirement**: Teacher voices (minimum 3-5 educators) must be included in design before building begins.
3. **Pilot-first approach**: Deploy to 1-3 partner school districts with defined success metrics before scaling.
4. **Data privacy framework**: Required and approved before any Phase 3 development. Teacher data sovereignty is non-negotiable.
5. **Anti-appropriation guardrails**: All documentation and the tool itself must clearly position this as administrative relief, not a substitute for systemic change (pay, staffing, funding).

## Success Metrics (defined by Moira, endorsed by Council)

1. Hours saved per teacher per week (target: measurable reduction in administrative time)
2. Self-reported burnout reduction on a validated scale
3. Teacher retention in pilot districts versus control
4. Six-month reassessment gate: if no measurable improvement, pause and reassess honestly

## Final Decision

The Council approves the Teacher Relief Toolkit as a Scroll with all five modifications above. The Scroll is to be created by Scout-01 and forwarded to the Architect and Foreman for planning.

## Concerns Noted for Future Retrospective

- Julia's appropriation risk concern — monitor how pilot districts position the tool publicly
- Aida's adoption concern — track actual usage metrics, not just deployment
- Tekla requests personal review of the Phase 3 data privacy framework
