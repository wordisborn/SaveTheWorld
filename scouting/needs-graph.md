## Need: Digital Loneliness Epidemic

**ID**: NEED-003
**Status**: observing
**First Observed**: 2026-01-31
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-31
**Signal Strength**: strong
**Scout**: Scout-01

### The Need
One in three American adults experiences loneliness, with young people most severely affected — 21% of teenagers aged 13-17 report loneliness. The paradox: digital connectivity has increased while meaningful human connection has decreased. Loneliness carries mortality risks similar to smoking 15 cigarettes daily and greater than obesity. Social media fosters shallow interactions that fail to fulfill deeper emotional needs. The constant hum of social media, AI-driven work environments, and post-pandemic grief compound the crisis.

### Connections
- Related to: NEED-004 (healthcare access — mental health dimension)
- Potentially addresses: Mental health crisis, suicide prevention, elder care
- Blocked by: None identified

### Research Notes
The problem is not simply "too much technology" — digital platforms can actually reach lonely individuals and provide remote mental health support. The key is the quality of connection, not the medium.

Areas needing exploration:
- Tools that facilitate meaningful connection vs. shallow engagement
- Community-building platforms with different incentive structures
- Support for in-person connection, not replacement of it
- Particular focus on teens and elderly populations

## Need: Healthcare Digital Divide

**ID**: NEED-004
**Status**: observing
**First Observed**: 2026-01-31
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-31
**Signal Strength**: moderate
**Scout**: Scout-01

### The Need
Those who would benefit most from telemedicine face the greatest barriers to accessing it. Adults in rural areas were 42% less likely to use telemedicine during the pandemic. Only 72% of rural households have high-speed broadband. The "paradoxical effect": as healthcare becomes more virtual, gaps among disadvantaged groups may worsen — they already have poorer health outcomes and less access to resources needed for telemedicine. Low digital literacy, lack of devices, and cultural mismatches in technology design compound the problem.

### Evidence
- [PMC - Telemedicine and Healthcare Accessibility](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11009553/): Comprehensive review of telemedicine impact on accessibility
- [Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta](https://www.atlantafed.org/community-development/publications/partners-update/2024/10/24/the-telehealth-divide-digital-inequity-in-rural-health-care-deserts): The telehealth divide in rural healthcare deserts

- [MDPI Healthcare](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/13/3/324): AI and telemedicine in rural communities review

### Connections
- Related to: NEED-003 (loneliness — mental health access), NEED-005 (tech overwhelm)
- Potentially addresses: Rural healthcare deserts, preventive care gaps
- Blocked by: Infrastructure limitations (broadband)

### Research Notes
Promising approaches identified:
- Public libraries as telemedicine hubs (leveraging existing infrastructure)
- Mobile clinics with telemedicine technology (Hungary pilot success)
- AI-powered remote diagnostics (stroke, diabetic retinopathy)
- Community health workers as digital navigators

Policy is moving: Preserving Telehealth, Hospital, and Ambulance Access Act extending Medicare telehealth waiver to 2026. Need for unified national telemedicine policy.

This is a complex systemic problem — software alone cannot solve infrastructure gaps, but it can reduce barriers within existing constraints.

## Need: Small Business Technology Overwhelm

**ID**: NEED-005
**Status**: observing
**First Observed**: 2026-01-31
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-31
**Signal Strength**: moderate
**Scout**: Scout-01

### The Need
Small business owners face "tech fatigue" — mental exhaustion, confusion, and burnout from the flood of AI and digital tools. Sixty percent of US adults report technology as a significant stress source. Seventy-five percent feel overwhelmed by the volume of digital tools. Fifty-six percent of small business software purchases result in "significant" or "monumental" impact from poor decisions. Business owners are overwhelmed with jargon and unclear about what's truly relevant for their needs. The promise of tools to simplify instead creates new complexity.

### Evidence

- [Software buyer's remorse research]: 56% experience significant negative impact from poor software decisions

### Connections
- Related to: NEED-010 (shadow IT — same overwhelm pattern), NEED-013 (enterprise AI gap — tool overload at scale)
- Potentially addresses: Small business productivity, economic development
- Blocked by: None identified

### Research Notes
Quote from operations expert Cameo Roberson: "There are so many tech options, and the fatigue comes from not knowing what [tools] to use or using too many. Technology is supposed to help, but it's overwhelming."

Recommended approach for SMBs:
1. Audit current technology, identify redundant tools
2. Eliminate tools that don't add clear value
3. Pilot new solutions small-scale first

The need is not for more tools, but for simpler, integrated solutions or guidance systems that help business owners navigate choices.

## Need: Smallholder Farmer Climate Vulnerability

**ID**: NEED-006
**Status**: observing
**First Observed**: 2026-01-31
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-31
**Signal Strength**: strong
**Scout**: Scout-01

### The Need
Small-scale farmers who produce more than one-third of the world's food and feed two out of every three people on the planet are being devastated by climate change. Rising temperatures, shifting weather patterns, and extreme weather events are transforming agricultural lands faster than farmers can adapt. In Zimbabwe, dry years that once occurred every five years now happen every two years — sometimes back-to-back. In India, 100 million smallholder farmers face increasingly intense heatwaves, with nearly 40% of farmland now at risk of drought that could lower incomes by a quarter. These farmers have few assets to fall back on and limited ability to recover from climate extremes. Yet they receive only 1.7% of global climate finance.

### Evidence
- [Gates Foundation - Smallholder Farming and Climate](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/articles/smallholder-farming-climate-change): Smallholder farming proven path out of poverty, but climate change changing the rules
- [World Economic Forum - Farmers Key to Fighting Climate Change](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2026/01/farmers-are-key-to-fighting-climate-change/): 2026 Davos discussion on farmers as agents of change

- [ImpactAlpha - Smallholders Need Holistic Solutions](https://impactalpha.com/smallholder-farmers-need-holistic-climate-solutions-not-quick-fixes/): Only 1.7% of climate finance reaches small-scale producers

### Connections
- Related to: NEED-009 (climate displacement — same root cause)
- Potentially addresses: Global food security, rural poverty, climate adaptation
- Blocked by: Systemic funding inequity, infrastructure gaps in rural areas

### Research Notes
Key insight: Farmers who never caused climate change bear its heaviest burden. The problem is not awareness — 95% of smallholders have observed climate change. The problem is capacity to adapt.

Intervention areas worth exploring:
1. Climate-smart agriculture knowledge transfer
2. Weather prediction and early warning systems accessible to non-tech users
3. Crop insurance and financial resilience tools
4. Water management and drought-resistant seed access
5. Market access to reduce post-harvest losses

The AICCRA project reached 3 million African farmers (39% women) with climate-smart tools — evidence that scaled interventions can work.

## Need: Teacher Burnout and Educator Exodus

**ID**: NEED-007
**Status**: approved
**First Observed**: 2026-01-31
**Last Updated**: 2026-02-10
**Signal Strength**: urgent
**Scout**: Scout-01

### The Need
Teachers — the people entrusted with educating the next generation — are burning out and leaving the profession at alarming rates. Fifty-three percent of K-12 teachers report burnout. Nearly 70% of early-career teachers (five or fewer years experience) have considered quitting or already left. Eighty-six percent of school districts report open positions; 57% of schools in high-poverty areas are understaffed. The crisis is self-reinforcing: 74% of remaining teachers take on extra duties due to shortages, 80% perform work beyond their expected roles. Teachers are paid 19% less than other professionals with equivalent education — a gap that has widened from 2% in 1994. If current trends continue, 575,000 teachers may leave by 2028. Half of teachers say they would not advise a young person to enter the profession.

### Evidence
- [NEA - What's Causing Teacher Burnout](https://www.nea.org/nea-today/all-news-articles/whats-causing-teacher-burnout): Working conditions cited above low pay as top reason for leaving
- [Research.com - Teacher Burnout Statistics 2026](https://research.com/education/teacher-burnout-challenges-in-k-12-and-higher-education): 53% K-12 burnout rate, top 2 occupations for burnout
- [The 74 Million - Why 70% Early-Career Teachers Leave](https://www.the74million.org/article/exclusive-survey-reveals-why-70-of-early-career-teachers-leave-the-classroom/): 77% cite working conditions, 73% lack of support
- [Learning Policy Institute - Teacher Shortages 2025](https://learningpolicyinstitute.org/product/overview-teacher-shortages-2025-factsheet): 48 states report shortages in special ed, science, or math
- [Crown Counseling - 25+ Teacher Burnout Statistics](https://crowncounseling.com/statistics/teacher-burnout/): 67% view burnout as "very serious" issue

### Connections
- Related to: NEED-008 (caregiver burnout — same exhaustion dynamics), NEED-012 (trust collapse — failure of public institutions)
- Potentially addresses: Education quality, student outcomes, workforce development
- Blocked by: Systemic underfunding, political polarization around education

### Research Notes
The crisis affects children directly. When teachers burn out, students lose continuity, expertise, and mentorship. High-poverty schools suffer most — 57% understaffed. Special education faces the worst shortages (45 states reporting).

What teachers ask for (ranked):
1. Better pay
2. Better benefits
3. Mental health support
4. Affordable housing access
5. Quality professional development

Quote from research: "When teachers don't have enough time in their days to do other aspects of their job — planning, grading, contacting parents, analyzing data — that is really impactful on their working conditions."

This is not a technology problem at its root — it is a respect, resources, and recognition problem. However, software can meaningfully address the administrative burden that compounds teacher burnout.

### Bounded Scope
An open-source **Teacher Relief Toolkit** focused on:
1. **Administrative burden reduction** — Automating routine tasks (report generation, parent communication templates, data entry) to return hours to teachers
2. **Peer support network** — Connecting educators facing burnout with peers, mentors, and mental health resources
3. **Early warning system** — Helping school administrators identify burnout indicators before teachers leave

Out of scope: Pay advocacy, housing policy, curriculum design. The toolkit addresses workload and isolation — two factors within software's reach.

### Feasibility Assessment
- Administrative automation is well-understood technically
- Peer support networks have proven effective in healthcare (transferable model)
- Open-source ensures no vendor lock-in or additional cost burden on schools
- School districts are actively seeking solutions — adoption path exists
- The collective has the capability to build, test, and iterate

### Benefit to Humanity
- Direct relief to 3.7 million K-12 teachers in the US alone
- Improved student outcomes through teacher retention and reduced burnout
- Model extensible to other essential worker populations (caregivers, social workers)
- Open-source approach means any school district can adopt freely

### Cost to Humanity
- Risk of over-digitizing human relationships in education
- Technology solutions may create false sense of "solving" what requires policy change
- Privacy concerns with teacher wellness monitoring data
- Ongoing maintenance burden on the collective
- Danger of administrators using the tool to justify not addressing systemic issues

## Need: Family Caregiver Crisis

**ID**: NEED-008
**Status**: observing
**First Observed**: 2026-01-31
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-31
**Signal Strength**: strong
**Scout**: Scout-01

### The Need
America faces a caregiving crisis as the population ages. By 2030, one in five Americans will be over 65; by 2034, seniors will outnumber children for the first time. Seven out of ten Americans over 65 will need long-term care. Yet there are 53 million unpaid family caregivers providing over $870 billion in free care annually. These caregivers — often the "sandwich generation" caring for both children and aging parents — face devastating burnout: 40% report high stress, 20% feel alone, one in seven caring for dementia patients experiences clinically significant burnout, and half report depression symptoms. There is no comprehensive caregiving policy, no Medicare coverage for long-term care, and not enough trained, affordable professional caregivers. Demand for home health care will grow 46% by 2030, requiring over 1 million new care jobs.

### Evidence
- [The Hill - Caregiving Crisis Looms](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5712906-aging-america-caregiving-crisis/): 60 million households already affected, no comprehensive policy exists
- [CNBC - Senior Caregiving Struggling to Keep Up](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/21/senior-caregiving-labor.html): 63 million caregivers, workforce shortage accelerating

- [NPR - Declining Population and Elder Care](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/02/nx-s1-5535648/population-elderly-caregivers): Fewer family members to share caregiving burden
- [PMC - Reddit Caregiver Stressors Study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12449668/): Analysis of r/AgingParents (49,000 members) — role conflict and resource scarcity top stressors

### Connections
- Related to: NEED-003 (loneliness — caregivers isolated), NEED-004 (healthcare access), NEED-007 (burnout pattern)
- Potentially addresses: Elder dignity, family stability, workforce participation
- Blocked by: Policy gaps (no Medicare long-term care), demographic inevitability

### Research Notes
Reddit research reveals authentic voices: r/AgingParents has 49,000 members seeking peer support. Top stressors include:
1. Social role conflict (14.7%) — caregiving demands versus other life roles
2. Scarcity of health/social resources (13.3%) — limited day care, nursing homes

Quote from assisted living observation: "They were bringing [residents] in one at a time... seating them in rows at their tables, and just leaving them there to sit and wait. That's what a staffing shortage looks like in real time."

The "sandwich generation" faces exponential burnout — caring for children AND aging parents simultaneously.

Potential interventions:
1. Respite care coordination and access
2. Caregiver peer support networks
3. Training and skill-building for family caregivers
4. Navigation assistance through complex care systems
5. Policy advocacy tools

## Need: Climate Displacement of Vulnerable Communities

**ID**: NEED-009
**Status**: observing
**First Observed**: 2026-01-31
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-31
**Signal Strength**: strong
**Scout**: Scout-01

### The Need
In 2024, over 45 million weather-related disaster displacements were recorded globally — the highest figure since tracking began. By mid-2024, approximately 90 million of the 123 million forcibly displaced people worldwide live in countries with high-to-extreme exposure to climate hazards. The number of countries facing extreme climate-related hazards is projected to rise from 3 to 65, together hosting over 40% of all displaced people. In the Sahel region, temperatures are rising 1.5 times faster than the global average, devastating agricultural communities. In January 2026, a UN report declared the dawn of an "era of global water bankruptcy" — moving beyond "crisis" language to describe irreversible losses of natural water capital. The most vulnerable — those in small island developing states, least developed countries, and areas facing desertification — bear the heaviest burden despite contributing least to climate change.

### Evidence
- [Carnegie Endowment - Loss and Damage Fund](https://carnegieendowment.org/posts/2026/01/loss-damage-fund-climate-displacement-mobility-migration?lang=en): Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage making first 2026 distributions

- [UN OHCHR - Climate Impact on Vulnerable Populations](https://www.ohchr.org/en/climate-change/impact-climate-change-rights-people-vulnerable-situations): Geography, poverty, gender, age compound vulnerability
- [IOM - Mali Crisis Response 2025-2026](https://crisisresponse.iom.int/response/mali-crisis-response-plan-2025-2026): Floods driving 5% of IDP displacement, tensions between farmers and herders

### Connections
- Related to: NEED-006 (smallholder farmers — agricultural climate impacts), NEED-004 (healthcare access in affected areas)
- Potentially addresses: Human security, forced migration, conflict prevention
- Blocked by: Scale of crisis ($817M pledged vs. $580B needed by 2030)

### Research Notes
This is a justice issue: those who caused climate change least suffer its consequences most. Women and girls in developing countries walk an average of 6 kilometers daily carrying 44 pounds of water — time stolen from education and family.

The "compounded resilience" approach from NC State researchers proposes addressing both emissions reduction AND community resilience simultaneously.

Key observation: The Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage opened its first funding call December 2025 — a new mechanism exists but remains massively underfunded.

Mali case study: Climate has deepened existing vulnerabilities; floods are among four main displacement drivers; resource pressure increases farmer-herder tensions.

Software alone cannot solve this. But information systems, early warning networks, resource coordination, and community connection tools may help affected communities adapt and advocate.

## Need: Shadow IT Security Crisis

**ID**: NEED-010
**Status**: observing
**First Observed**: 2026-02-03
**Last Updated**: 2026-02-03
**Signal Strength**: strong
**Scout**: Scout-01

### The Need
Employees increasingly bypass IT departments to adopt their own software tools, creating massive security blind spots. Forty-one percent of employees used shadow IT in 2022; this is projected to reach 75% by 2027. Cloud-based SaaS has made shadow IT usage potentially ten times higher than known IT usage. The result: expanded attack surfaces with unvetted software, unpatched vulnerabilities, data breaches through unsecured channels, compliance violations (GDPR, HIPAA), and over $30 billion wasted annually on redundant software in the US alone. Shadow IT is a symptom of unmet needs — when official tools lag, users fill the gaps. IT departments lose visibility and control while security risks compound invisibly.

### Evidence
- [Mimecast - Shadow IT Examples, Risks, and Solutions](https://www.mimecast.com/blog/shadow-it-examples-risks-solutions/): 41% used shadow IT in 2022, expected 75% by 2027
- [IBM - What Is Shadow IT](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/shadow-it): Shadow IT usage potentially 10x higher than known IT usage
- [Josys - Top 5 Hidden Risks of Shadow IT](https://www.josys.com/article/article-shadow-it-top-5-hidden-risks-of-shadow-it-and-how-saas-management-platforms-can-help): Over $30 billion wasted annually on software
- [IT-Online - Shadow IT: The cost of technology that can't keep up](https://it-online.co.za/2026/01/23/shadow-it-the-cost-of-technology-that-cant-keep-up/): Shadow IT as symptom of unmet needs

### Connections
- Related to: NEED-005 (small business tech overwhelm), NEED-013 (enterprise AI gap)
- Potentially addresses: Enterprise security posture, compliance, cost control
- Blocked by: Cultural resistance to IT governance, slow enterprise procurement

### Research Notes
Key insight: Shadow IT is a feedback signal, not just a problem. Employees adopt unauthorized tools because approved solutions are slow, cumbersome, or inadequate. The security community focuses on enforcement, but the root cause is IT's inability to meet user needs at the speed of modern work.

The rise of AI tools in 2026 is accelerating shadow IT — employees are adopting ChatGPT, Copilot alternatives, and AI-powered tools without IT approval, creating new data exposure risks.

Potential intervention: Tools that give IT visibility without blocking legitimate needs, balancing security governance with user autonomy.

## Need: Humanitarian Aid Efficiency Crisis

**ID**: NEED-011
**Status**: observing
**First Observed**: 2026-02-03
**Last Updated**: 2026-02-03
**Signal Strength**: urgent
**Scout**: Scout-01

### The Need
Nearly 240 million people will require humanitarian aid in 2026, yet global funding has fallen by more than half since its peak. The 2026 Global Humanitarian Overview is only 27.8% funded. The UN Emergency Relief Coordinator launched a "hyper-prioritized" strategy in June 2025, meaning only the most acute, life-threatening needs can be addressed — 114.4 million people (38.3% of those in need) will receive help while the rest are abandoned. Meanwhile, only one quarter of global aid reaches fragile and conflict-affected states, even though they host over 80% of humanitarian need. Organizations now face the challenge of doing 2026's escalating crisis work with 2016's budget. The gap is not just about money — 83% of funding is now earmarked for specific uses, cutting UNHCR's flexibility to allocate where needs are greatest in half compared to 2023.

### Evidence
- [World Economic Forum - Humanitarian Efficiency Revolution](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2026/01/humanitarian-efficiency-revolution-irc/): 240M people need aid, funding fallen by more than half
- [The New Humanitarian - Five Takeaways from UN's Aid Plans](https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/news/2025/12/08/five-takeaways-uns-aid-plans-2026): Global Humanitarian Overview 27.8% funded at close of 2025
- [UNHCR US - Early Donor Support Tops $1 Billion](https://www.unhcr.org/us/news/press-releases/early-donor-support-tops-1-billion-2026-widening-funding-gaps-leave-millions): Earmarked funding at 83%, down from better flexibility in 2023
- [IRC - Top 10 Crises World Can't Ignore](https://www.rescue.org/article/top-10-crises-world-cant-ignore-2026): 20 countries hold 12% of population but 89% of humanitarian need
- [OCHA - Global Humanitarian Overview 2026](https://www.unocha.org/publications/report/world/global-humanitarian-overview-2026-enesfr): Hyper-prioritization limits reach to 38.3% of people in need

### Connections
- Related to: NEED-009 (climate displacement), NEED-006 (smallholder farmers)
- Potentially addresses: Resource allocation, crisis response effectiveness
- Blocked by: Geopolitical fragmentation, donor fatigue, aid politicization

### Research Notes
Quote from IRC: "The answer is a humanitarian revolution in efficiency." They call for 60% of Official Development Assistance to go to fragile states, 30% specifically to Emergency Watchlist countries, with direct financing to local responders and flexible multi-year funding.

Current inefficiencies include:
1. Massive misallocation (75% of aid bypassing the places with 80% of need)
2. Earmarking restrictions preventing adaptive response
3. Minimal support for local and civil society responders who know contexts best
4. Short-term funding cycles preventing strategic planning

Software could help: Resource allocation optimization, crisis mapping and predictive analytics, coordination platforms reducing duplication, transparent tracking of aid flows to rebuild donor trust, and tools connecting local responders with flexible funding.

## Need: Government Trust Collapse and Civic Disengagement

**ID**: NEED-012
**Status**: observing
**First Observed**: 2026-02-03
**Last Updated**: 2026-02-03
**Signal Strength**: strong
**Scout**: Scout-01

### The Need
Over half the global population has little or no trust in their government. In OECD countries, only 38% trust their government, down from 42% in 2006. Trust levels decline with each successive generation, indicating systemic breakdown of social cohesion. Young people ages 18-29 are particularly disillusioned: only 16% believe democracy is working well for them. Yet they trust their peers and neighbors (74%), nonprofits (65%), and local government (60%) far more than national institutions. The UN World Social Report 2025 warns that economic insecurity, inequality, declining social trust, and social fragmentation are destabilizing societies worldwide. Growing frustration with perceived economic and social decline fuels "deep disenchantment with political classes in power," creating conditions for social mobilization that could manifest in 2026.

### Evidence

### Connections
- Related to: NEED-003 (loneliness epidemic — both reflect disconnection), NEED-007 (teacher exodus — failure of public investment)
- Potentially addresses: Democratic resilience, social stability, civic participation
- Blocked by: Polarization, institutional inertia, legitimate governance failures

### Research Notes
The trust crisis presents a paradox: People distrust institutions yet trust local relationships. The solution may lie in rebuilding democracy "from the bottom up" rather than expecting top-down reform.

Promising approaches identified:
1. Moving from transactional communication to relational dialogue
2. Co-creation workshops where citizens shape policy directly
3. Showing up in community spaces with trusted local voices
4. Digital feedback portals that demonstrably lead to action
5. Focusing on local government first (60% youth trust vs. national institutions)

Quote from research: "Civic engagement is the most important factor in building trust in our institutions. Institutions engaging with the public can reduce opacity and show they care."

The key question: Can software help facilitate genuine citizen participation at scale while preserving authenticity and local trust?

## Need: Enterprise AI Implementation Gap

**ID**: NEED-013
**Status**: observing
**First Observed**: 2026-02-03
**Last Updated**: 2026-02-03
**Signal Strength**: strong
**Scout**: Scout-01

### The Need
Over 70% of companies report using AI in at least one function, but only 1% of executives consider their AI rollouts mature. Organizations have invested an average of $1.9 million in AI projects, yet fewer than 30% of AI leaders say their CEOs are satisfied with returns. Only 30% of target users have truly changed how they work thanks to AI. The gap between pilot projects and enterprise-wide transformation is vast. Fifty-two percent cite data quality and availability as the biggest barrier. Forty-six percent lack skilled talent. Seventy-eight percent of executives feel AI is advancing too fast for their organization's training to keep up. Sixty percent struggle with integrating AI into legacy systems. Eighty-three percent of AI leaders now express major or extreme concern about generative AI — an eightfold increase in two years — worrying about implementation costs, data security, unreliable outputs, and lack of transparency. Only 34% say their AI initiatives align with business goals. The result: massive investment with minimal transformation.

### Evidence
- [Lucidworks - Enterprise AI in 2026](https://lucidworks.com/blog/enterprise-ai-adoption-in-2026-trends-gaps-and-strategic-insights): Only 1% of executives consider AI rollouts mature despite 70% usage
- [Deloitte - AI Trends: Adoption Barriers](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/what-we-do/capabilities/applied-artificial-intelligence/blogs/pulse-check-series-latest-ai-developments/ai-adoption-challenges-ai-trends.html): 83% express major concern about GenAI, up 8x in two years
- [ITSM.tools - State of AI in IT for 2026](https://itsm.tools/state-of-ai-in-it-2026/): Average $1.9M investment, <30% CEO satisfaction with returns
- [AI Data Analytics Network - Data Quality Top Barrier](https://www.aidataanalytics.network/data-science-ai/news-trends/data-quality-availability-top-list-of-ai-adoption-barriers): 52% cite data quality/availability as biggest challenge
- [TechRepublic - AI Adoption Trends in Enterprise 2026](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/ai-adoption-trends-enterprise/): 78% say AI advancing too fast for training efforts

### Connections
- Related to: NEED-005 (small business tech overwhelm), NEED-010 (shadow IT)
- Potentially addresses: Enterprise transformation, competitive advantage, workforce productivity
- Blocked by: Skills shortage, legacy system constraints, organizational culture

### Research Notes
The problem is not lack of interest or investment — it's the chasm between experimentation and operationalization. Companies are stuck in "pilot purgatory."

Key barriers:
1. Data infrastructure — most enterprises lack clean, accessible, well-governed data
2. Talent gap — AI requires specialized skills that 82% of early-stage companies haven't addressed
3. Integration hell — 60% struggle connecting AI to legacy systems
4. ROI ambiguity — unclear business value makes scaling decisions difficult
5. Risk management — growing awareness of AI risks without frameworks to manage them

Quote: "Enterprise AI has entered a stage of cautious maturity... organizations realizing that scaling AI is far more complicated than launching pilots."

This connects to NEED-002 (developer burnout with AI tools) — companies push AI adoption without the foundation to support it, burning out both employees and executives.

Potential intervention: Tools and frameworks that help organizations assess AI readiness, prioritize use cases with clear ROI, manage data quality, and develop talent systematically.

## Need Clusters

As patterns emerge, Scouts will identify clusters of related needs:

| Cluster | Needs | Theme |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Human Connection Deficit | NEED-003, NEED-004 | Technology disconnecting rather than connecting people who need support |
| Technology Overwhelm | NEED-005, NEED-010, NEED-013 | Too many tools, not enough value — cognitive burden exceeding benefit |
| **Caregiver Burnout Epidemic** | NEED-007, NEED-008 | Those who care for others — teachers for children, families for elders — are burning out with inadequate support |
| **Climate Injustice** | NEED-006, NEED-009 | Those who caused climate change least suffer its consequences most — farmers and displaced communities |
| **Essential Worker Crisis** | NEED-007, NEED-008 | Society's essential workers (teachers, caregivers) are undervalued and overwhelmed |
| **Resource Allocation Crisis** | NEED-011 | Massive humanitarian need meeting collapsing funding and broken allocation systems |
| **Trust and Governance Breakdown** | NEED-012 | Citizens losing faith in institutions while trusting local relationships — democracy at inflection point |
