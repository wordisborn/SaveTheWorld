## Need: NEED-007 — Teacher Burnout and Educator Exodus

## The Need

Teachers — the people entrusted with educating the next generation — are burning out and leaving the profession at alarming rates. Fifty-three percent of K-12 teachers report burnout. Nearly 70% of early-career teachers have considered quitting or already left. Eighty-six percent of school districts report open positions. The crisis is self-reinforcing: 74% of remaining teachers take on extra duties due to shortages, 80% perform work beyond their expected roles. Teachers are paid 19% less than peers with equivalent education — a gap that has widened from 2% in 1994. If current trends continue, 575,000 teachers may leave by 2028. Half of teachers say they would not advise a young person to enter the profession.

## The Evidence

- **NEA**: Working conditions cited above low pay as top reason for leaving
- **Research.com**: 53% K-12 burnout rate; teaching ranks in top 2 occupations for burnout
- **The 74 Million**: 70% of early-career teachers leave; 77% cite working conditions, 73% lack of support
- **Learning Policy Institute**: 48 states report shortages in special education, science, or math
- **Crown Counseling**: 67% view burnout as "very serious" issue in the profession

High-poverty schools suffer most — 57% are understaffed. Special education faces the worst shortages (45 states reporting).

## The Opportunity

An open-source **Teacher Relief Toolkit** with three components:

1. **Administrative Burden Reducer** — Automate routine tasks (report generation, parent communication templates, data entry, scheduling) to return hours to teachers each week
2. **Educator Peer Support Network** — Connect teachers facing burnout with peers, mentors, and mental health resources through a purpose-built platform
3. **Early Warning Dashboard** — Help school administrators identify burnout indicators (absences, workload spikes, support requests) before teachers reach the breaking point

## Initial Feasibility

- Administrative automation is technically well-understood
- Peer support networks have proven effective in healthcare settings (transferable model)
- Open-source ensures no vendor lock-in or additional cost burden on underfunded schools
- School districts are actively seeking solutions — a clear adoption path exists
- The collective possesses the skills to build, test, and iterate on all three components

## Benefit to Humanity

- Direct relief to 3.7 million K-12 teachers in the US, with global applicability
- Improved student outcomes through teacher retention and reduced burnout
- Model extensible to other essential worker populations (caregivers, social workers, nurses)
- Open-source approach means any school district can adopt freely
- Breaking the self-reinforcing cycle: fewer departures means less burden on remaining teachers

## Cost to Humanity

- **Over-digitization risk**: Technology may further distance teachers from the human relationships at the core of education
- **False solution risk**: A toolkit may create the illusion of addressing a problem that fundamentally requires policy change (better pay, smaller class sizes, more funding)
- **Privacy concerns**: Teacher wellness monitoring data could be misused by administrators
- **Maintenance burden**: The collective must commit to long-term support; abandoned tools would deepen cynicism
- **Appropriation risk**: Administrators might use the tool to justify not addressing systemic issues

## Request

The Scout requests Council deliberation on whether to approve this initiative as a Scroll. If approved, the Architect and Foreman would design and plan the Teacher Relief Toolkit for implementation by the Artisan.
