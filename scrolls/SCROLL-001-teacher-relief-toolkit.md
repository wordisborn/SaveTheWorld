## Summary

An open-source, phased toolkit to reduce the administrative burden crushing K-12 teachers, beginning with workflow automation and expanding — with demonstrated value — to peer support and early warning capabilities. Built with teachers, not for them. Administrative relief, not a substitute for systemic change.

## The Need

Teachers are burning out and leaving at alarming rates. 53% report burnout. 70% of early-career teachers consider leaving. 86% of districts have open positions. The crisis is self-reinforcing: remaining teachers absorb extra duties, accelerating their own burnout. Teachers are paid 19% below equivalent professionals. 575,000 may leave by 2028.

High-poverty schools suffer most — 57% are understaffed. Special education faces the worst shortages (45 states reporting).

## Benefit to Humanity

- Direct relief to 3.7 million K-12 teachers in the US, with global applicability
- Improved student outcomes through teacher retention and reduced burnout
- Model extensible to other essential worker populations (caregivers, social workers)
- Open-source approach means any school district can adopt freely
- Breaking the self-reinforcing cycle: fewer departures means less burden on remaining teachers

## Cost to Humanity

- **Over-digitization risk**: Technology may distance teachers from the human relationships at the core of education
- **False solution risk**: A toolkit may create the illusion of addressing a problem that fundamentally requires policy change — better pay, smaller class sizes, more funding
- **Appropriation risk**: Administrators or policymakers may use the tool as political cover to avoid systemic investment (Julia's noted concern)
- **Privacy risk**: Teacher wellness data could be misused if not properly governed (Tekla's noted concern)
- **Adoption uncertainty**: Schools are slow adopters; open source does not guarantee usage (Aida's noted concern)
- **Maintenance burden**: The collective must commit to long-term support

### Horse Trading Acknowledgment

> Every gift has a price. This toolkit can relieve administrative suffering but cannot fix broken funding, inadequate pay, or political neglect of education. The trade is worth making because reduced administrative burden is achievable now, while systemic change requires longer timelines. We must be honest that we are treating a symptom — an important symptom — not the disease.

## Scope

### Phase 1: Administrative Burden Reducer (Primary)
- Automated report generation
- Parent communication templates
- Data entry reduction and workflow automation
- Scheduling assistance
- **Gate**: Demonstrated time savings and burnout reduction in pilot before Phase 2

### Phase 2: Educator Peer Support Network
- Platform connecting teachers with peers, mentors, and mental health resources
- Built for authentic connection, not shallow engagement
- **Gate**: Phase 1 success demonstrated; co-design with teacher users of Phase 1

### Phase 3: Early Warning Dashboard (Conditional)
- Burnout indicator identification for school administrators
- **Prerequisite**: Data privacy framework reviewed and approved by Tekla
- Teacher data sovereignty: educators control their own data
- Data minimization and purpose limitation enforced
- **Gate**: Phase 2 success demonstrated; privacy framework approved

### Out of Scope
- Pay advocacy or policy lobbying
- Housing assistance programs
- Curriculum design tools
- Replacing human connection with digital substitutes

## Success Criteria

1. **Hours saved**: Measurable reduction in administrative time per teacher per week
2. **Burnout reduction**: Improvement on validated burnout assessment scales
3. **Retention impact**: Teacher retention in pilot districts versus comparable non-pilot districts
4. **Six-month gate**: If no measurable improvement after six months of pilot use, pause and reassess honestly

## Initial Constraints

- **Co-design required**: Minimum 3-5 practicing teachers involved in design before building begins
- **Pilot-first**: Deploy to 1-3 partner school districts before any scaling
- **Anti-appropriation messaging**: All documentation, README files, and the tool itself must clearly state this is administrative relief, not a substitute for systemic change
- **Privacy-first for Phase 3**: No early warning code written until data privacy framework is approved
- **Accessibility**: Must work in under-resourced environments; simplest version should function on a phone

## Council Notes

- **Dinah**: Start with admin reducer — clear technical patterns, provable value. Proof of concept before commitment.
- **Ivy**: Phase gates must be real gates, not rubber stamps. Clear ownership at every phase.
- **Tekla**: Will personally review the Phase 3 data privacy framework. Teacher data sovereignty is non-negotiable.
- **Moira**: Treat this as an experiment. Define metrics before building. Accept results honestly.
- **Aida**: If the pilot fails, we stop. No sunk-cost reasoning.
- **Camila**: Teacher voices at the table from day one. Design with, not for.
- **Julia**: Monitor how pilot districts position the tool publicly. Our messaging must be unambiguous.
